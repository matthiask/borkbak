borkbak - git backup archive compressor
=======================================

borkbak is built for backup scripts which use git to store hourly snapshots,
but do not want to keep old versions around forever.

It rebuilds git history using the following rules:

* Retain every version for the last 7 days
* Keep daily snapshots for the last 30 days
* Keep weekly snaphosts for half a year
* Afterwards, only store monthly snapshots
